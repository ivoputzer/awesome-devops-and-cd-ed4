#Â template assignment

Create a basic template (html/css/js) or mockup for the `battlefield` game that we can use as part of, or to develop the application;
  - look for different implementations of the game available online;
  - think of how the game should be structured and work;
  - think of what the user interactions would be in order to play the game (all possible interactions with the game);
  - (optional) think of interactions with the backend
    - how to make it multiplayer (discovery, lobby, etc)
    - how to make it singlepayer (bots, etc)

- open a pull request to submit your solution

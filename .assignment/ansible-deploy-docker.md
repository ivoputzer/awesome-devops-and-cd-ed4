- create an ansible playbook for deploying our project to a VM automatically using ansible.
  - make sure latest version of the project is running on the server once the playbook is run.
  - make sure older versions of the project are being removed from there server once the playbook is run.

- (optional) fork github repository, create github action `Production Deploy` that deploys every commit automatically.
